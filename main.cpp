// Build note: Do NOT mistakenly include _int_gl_4_4.h.  That one doesn't define OpenGL stuff 
// first.
// Build note: Also need to link opengl32.lib (unknown directory, but VS seems to know where it 
// is, so don't put in an "Additional Library Directories" entry for it).
// Build note: Also need to link glload/lib/glloadD.lib.

// Build note: Also need to link freeglut/lib/freeglutD.lib.  However, the linker will try to 
// find "freeglut.lib" (note the lack of "D") instead unless the following preprocessor 
// directives are set either here or in the source-building command line (VS has a
// "Preprocessor" section under "C/C++" for preprocessor definitions).
// Build note: Also need to link winmm.lib (VS seems to know where it is, so don't put in an 
// "Additional Library Directories" entry).
